# Discord-Voice-Chat-Game-Activities
Start YouTube Together, Poker Night, Betrayal.io, or Fishington.io in a Discord voice channel without paying.

All you need to do is run the Python script, fill in the fields, and it will give you an invite link.
Post the invite link in a text channel and then click the link directly. It should launch the activity.

The options are:
1. Youtube Together
2. Poker Night
3. Betrayal.io
4. Fishington.io

These games built into Discord are the only ones that are known to exist.
You do not need to pay for any of them.
No data is sent to third parties, the data is only sent to Discord. You can verify this by checking the script yourself.
